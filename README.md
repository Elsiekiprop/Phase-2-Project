# Phase-2-Project
## **Business Problem**
A number of factors influence the pricing of houses. Therefore, a real estate agency would love to provide advisory services to homeowners who would love to sell their houses and to those clients who would want to purchase new houses on the prices of houses.
The agency needs to understand what factors have an effect on the house prices and to what extent. This is to enable homeowners who want to sell their homes to get the best price out of their sale. The clients who would love to buy homes wwill benefit from this advice as they'll be able to properly budget depending on their preferences. 
To be able to determine the factors that affect the prices of houses, the '''kc_house_data.csv''' will be used to carry out an analysis in order to provide the optimal advice.
